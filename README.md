GIF of user experience

This is an app I made for my mom, who needed a quick way to collect and submit newsletter sign-ups.  It was my first React Native application (Built with Expo). 

The app is not deployed to the Google store. I just installed it manually on the client device.

The app is really simple. 

It has a form to collect sign ups.
It has a page for processing the sign-ups. 
The subscription queue, processed with an event name, and saved to Mailchimp with bulk write api Mailchimp endpoint.
